The decision tree with automatic model generation (DAMG) algorithm simplifies multinomial classification problems into a series of binary tasks.  Classification problems are an intrinsic part of a variety of fields.  Further, deep learning is seemingly capable of achieving high rates of classification.  However, deep learning solutions are difficult to interpret and are prone to overfit to the training data.  They also fail in small data settings.  The recursive DAMG uses variable selection and meta-classes to disentangle multinomial classification problems with many variables.  While the example shown uses 2D pill shape image data and the standard MPEG-7 shape data, the algorithm is applicable to non-image classification problems as well.  The DAMG algorithm was able to outperform other approaches by about 177% for pill shape classification and CNNs by about 156% and 148% on the training and validation data, respectively, for a subset of the MEPG-7 data.
