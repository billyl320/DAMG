# MPEG-7

Inlcudes experiments related to the subset of the MPEG-7 analyzed.  Includes the code, images, and results.  The images are provided in the data folder.  The metrics collected for the DAMG model are provided in the mpeg_txt_files folder.  convert2.py collects these metrics.  convert_cnn.py provides some needed functions to for the CNN model.  mpeg_7_cnn.py build the CNN model.  output_cnn.txt provides the output from the CNN model including the confusion matrices for each of the random partitions.  output_rf_mpeg7.txt is the output of the 5 random partitions of the DAMG model using 3 variables and a random forest at each parent node for classification.  recall_cnn.r calculates recall for the CNN model.  rf_tree_val
.r provides the functions to build a DAMG model using a RF at each parent node.  ultima.py collects the metrics on the images.  ultima_rf_mpeg_7.r is the script that builds the DAMG models across the 5 paritions.  This requires code from Kinser's "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" (2018) (specifically the Plop function).
