## NLM Pill Shape Data

Includes experiments related to the NLM Pill shape data.  Also includes the code and results.  Images are from https://github.com/billyl320/SPEI-Paper.  The metrics collected for the DAMG model are provided in the data_txt folder.  plots_trees is a folder containing vizualizations of all of the resulting DAMG trees for the pill shape classification across the 5 random partitions. convert.py collects these metrics.  damg_map.r calcualtes the MAP across several models.  mar_hmh_lamberti.r calcualtes MAR for the HMH Lamberti etal. model. output_guided_41.txt is the output of the 5 random partitions of the DAMG model using 2 variables and an SVM with a polynomial kernel at each parent node for classification.  output_other_mods.r provides the output for other models built for comparison.  Some of these came from https://github.com/billyl320/human_decision_tree_pills.  recall_maddala.r calculates recall for the HMH Maddala etal. model. svm_tree_val .r provides the functions to build a DAMG model using an SVM at each parent node. ultima.py collects the metrics on the images. ultima_guided_41.r is the script that builds the DAMG models across the 5 paritions.  ultima_other_mods.r is an adjusted script from https://github.com/billyl320/human_decision_tree_pills.  This requires code from Kinser's "Image Operators: Image Processing in Python" (2018) (specifically the Plop function from mgcreate).
